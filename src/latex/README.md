[Return to top README.md](../../README.md)

To work on a `.tex` document, first install [LaTeX](https://miktex.org/download) and then install an editor, I prefer [TexMaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)

```TeX
$y=mx+b$
```

$y=mx+b$

## Bibliography

Add the new citation to the `.bib` file.

If you don't see the bibliography right away when you compile the document, run "Quick Build" a couple times, followed by "BibTeX" mode once, followed by "Quick Build" mode one or two more times.
